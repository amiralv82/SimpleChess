# SimpleChess
In this project, a simple chess has been designed by java. In this chess, it is possible to play in two-player and single-player mode, and for this reason, it has basic and simple artificial intelligence, so that it is possible to play single-player. There is also the ability to save the game and resume the game.
Among the weaknesses of this game:
1- Basic and weak artificial intelligence
2- The impossibility of changing the pawn at the end of the board to other pieces
3- Absence of Kish (the game ends when one of the players kills the opponent's king)
